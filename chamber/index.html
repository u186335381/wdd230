            <p>The Valparaiso Chamber of Commerce serves as a gathering place for local businesses and companies who
                desire
                to increase their profit and reduce losses by gathering ideas to combat the increased burglaries and
                robberies of the area, to request the government for increased security to maintain their business
                safe.
                Also, they help one another with counseling to know that skills are most required to run a business,
                so
                that
                every business owner knows what knowledge could be most helpful to increase sales and reduce cost.
